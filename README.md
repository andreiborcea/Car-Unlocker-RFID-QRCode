# Car-Unlocker-RFID-QRCode
Unlock,Lock and turn on/off engine with your smartphone or a tag


This project help you to solve problem in some cars like mine.I had a lot of issues with the central locking so i decide to create one
with Arduino.I use first an RFID module but was not so good because had a very low action range.
So i decided to pass to bluetooth so i got one for 3 euros and i put togheter some code to make it work.
I also made an app android that allows you to lock and unlock your car.

Anyway sometimes can be very usefull a button so i add one.So you can use the button to lock/unlock the car or use the bluetooth with the app.
